# Coinster
A simple and fast game I created 

The purpose of the game is to collect 3 coins before heading to the door.

It is not always easy as the monster becomes quicker and quicker the more coins you will have.

How to play:
1. `pip install pygame` in the terminal. 
2. Copy the monster.png, coin.png, robot.png and door.png files into a folder 
3. Run `python3 main.py`
